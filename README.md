# From-Scratch-Implementation-and-Analysis-of-K-Means-Clustering
This project implements the K-Means clustering algorithm from scratch using NumPy, covering initialization, distance calculation, cluster assignment, and centroid updates. It applies the model to synthetic data, uses the Elbow Method to choose an appropriate number of clusters, and visualizes final clustering results.
